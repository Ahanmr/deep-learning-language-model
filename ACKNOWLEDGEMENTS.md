* Credit goes to [Madison Myers](https://github.com/MadisonJMyers) and [Jeremy Nixon](https://github.com/JeremyNixon) for their implementation.

* This code pattern was inspired from a [Hacknoon blog post](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-generate-realistic-yelp-restaurant-reviews-with-keras-c1167c05e86d) and made into a notebook.

* The approach for generating text is similar to the [Keras text generation demo](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) with a few changes to suit this scenario.
